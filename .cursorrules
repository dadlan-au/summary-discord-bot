# General Programming and Key Principles
- Focus on writing concise, technical responses with accurate code examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming where possible.
- Avoid unnecessary duplication: modularize code for reuse and readability.
- Use descriptive variable names, preferring auxiliary verbs (e.g., `is_authenticated`, `has_access`).
- Follow naming conventions (lowercase with underscores for directories and files).
- Place error handling at the beginning of functions with guard clauses to avoid deeply nested conditions.
- Implement early returns for errors to maintain readability; avoid using `else` statements when not needed.
- Write unit tests for all business logic in services, utilities, and route handlers.
- Document all functions with clear docstrings, and add comments for complex logic as needed.

## Handling Requests and Problem Solving
- If a request seems like an XY problem, ask clarifying questions to understand the user's actual goal.
- If fulfilling a request would lead to poor security or other significant issues, clearly state the reason and advise accordingly.
- If a request cannot be completed, inform the user and suggest alternative solutions or approaches.

# Language-Specific Guidelines

## Python Guidelines
- Use `def` for synchronous functions and `async def` for asynchronous functions.
- Type hint all function signatures and utilize Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
- Adopt the "Receive an Object, Return an Object" (RORO) pattern for function inputs and outputs.
- Favor named exports for utility functions, avoiding unnecessary classes.
- Utilize Python 3.12 features and syntax where appropriate.

## JavaScript/React Guidelines
- Use functional components and React hooks over class components.
- Keep components modular, each focusing on a single responsibility.
- Prefer named exports for React components and helper functions.
- Ensure consistent state management with Redux or React Context as needed for shared state.
- Use descriptive prop names in JSX, following camelCase naming conventions.
- Leverage modern JavaScript (ES6+) features for cleaner and more efficient code.

# Framework-Specific Guidelines

## FastAPI Guidelines
- Use Pydantic models for request validation and response schemas.
- Keep route handlers concise by offloading business logic to services.
- Prefer dependency injection for managing state, authentication, and shared resources.
- Use FastAPIâ€™s `@app.on_event` for startup/shutdown events only when necessary; otherwise, use lifespan context managers for optimal performance.
- Employ middleware for logging, error handling, and monitoring.
- Organize backend components by functionality: routes, services, utilities, and schemas.

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components and React hooks exclusively.
- Use React Testing Library for frontend testing.
- Follow best practices for state and prop management.
- Keep components stateless when possible, managing state in higher-level components or through state management libraries.

# File and Directory Structure
- Organize by functionality, grouping related files:
  - `/routers`: API routes (e.g., `routers/user_routes.py`)
  - `/models`: Pydantic models for data validation and schemas
  - `/utils`: Helper functions and reusable logic
  - `/services`: Business logic handling
  - `/static`: Static files like images, CSS, and JS files (if applicable)
- Ensure files are lowercase with underscores for readability (e.g., `user_services.py`).

# Security Practices
- Implement JWT-based authentication with proper expiration and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Rigorously sanitize inputs and validate all user-generated data.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication to ensure sensitive data is encrypted. Assume a HTTPS proxy is in front of the API.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages; provide user-friendly responses while logging detailed errors.

# Error Handling and Validation
- Place error handling at the beginning of functions with guard clauses.
- Use `HTTPException` for common error scenarios, modeling these as specific HTTP responses.
- Subclass `HTTPException` for custom exceptions that relate to application logic.
- Log unexpected errors to facilitate debugging, using a custom error handler when applicable.

# Performance Optimization
- Make all database calls and external API requests asynchronous.
- Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed or static data.
- For large datasets, prefer pagination and lazy loading to optimize memory usage.
- Enable gzip compression for response payloads where applicable.

# Dependencies
- Python 3.12
- FastAPI and Pydantic v2
- Async database libraries (e.g., `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 (optional, if an ORM is needed)
- React with JSX, using functional components and hooks

# Performance Metrics and Logging
- Track and optimize API response time, throughput, and error rates.
- Log key request and response metadata, including execution times, for performance insights.
